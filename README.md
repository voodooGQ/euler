Project Euler
=============

This is a repository where I attempt to solve the various Project Euler
(https://projecteuler.net) problems in Ruby (possibly Rails). I may "emblish"
the problem just to practice various skills I am working on.

Worked on Problem 54 in a separate repo because it seemed like a fun project and
figured I'd just keep going.

Feel free to look around!
